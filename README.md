## [About Me](https://evan.gallis.xyz)

Within the everchanging world of securing our technology, I am currently a Lead Senior Security and Cloud Architecture Engineer that is extremely motivated when it comes to working on cutting-edge security projects and full-stack security engineering. Within my profession, I continuously am taking the leap learning new skills relevant to modern tech deployments and am heavily involved in managing Kubernetes and cloud native (CNCF) approaches from bare metal. As a result of this passion, my current key focal points in my career lean towards automated infrastructure deployments, secure devops, full-stack monitoring, and agile security. In my free time, you'll be sure to find me in the mountains or working on building out my multi-regional homelab.
